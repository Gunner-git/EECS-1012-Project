Hey prof! This is how to run the project on your device!

Dependencies:
npm i express ejs nodemon node mysql fs chai mocha

Other things needed to be installed:
- XAMPP: Apache and MySQL handler
- MySQL

To start the project:
1. On XAMPP, start Apache and MySQL
NOTE: If MySQL doesn't start, go to task manager and end the mysqld task and then start it from XAMPP. It should work now.

2. execute npm run start in your terminal

To initially setup the database of words we need for the game to run:
1. Go to server.js
2. Comment out line 9 (we will uncomment it later)
3. Uncomment the code block under step 1
4. Run the game using npm run start and in your browser go to localhost:3000/setup
5. Once it says Created database, go back to server.js
6. Uncomment line 9 (we need this now!)
7. Comment out the code block under step 1 and uncomment the code block under step 2
8. Repeat step 4 and 5 (This time it should say Created Table instead)
9. For the last part, comment out the code block under step 2 and uncomment the code block under step 3
10. Repeat step 4 and 5 again (This time it should say Inserted data instead)

The database is now set up. You can now enjoy the game by going to localhost:3000/

Have fun :)
